  Welcome to The Play House — a beautifully designed space where little
  imaginations run wild and grown-ups can actually enjoy a coffee while it
  happens!
</p>
<p>
  We’re a family-run soft play café based in the heart of Marlborough, created
  with one simple goal: to offer a calm, beautiful play space for 0-8 year olds
  - a warm, welcoming environment that works just as well for toddlers as it
  does for tired parents.
</p>
<p>
  Our custom-built mini play town wraps around the room and features a builder’s
  yard (complete with foam bricks and high-vis vests), a cosy café, pretend
  shops, an arts & crafts corner and more — all made from wood, thoughtfully
  designed, and just the right size for curious little ones.
</p>
<p>
  We’ve also designed our café with grown-ups in mind — whether you're here to
  catch up with friends, take five with a flat white, or settle into a beanbag
  while your baby snoozes. With healthy snacks for kids, plenty of high chairs
  and bouncers, and a rotating menu of events and quieter sessions, we’ve tried
  to think of everything.
</p>
<h2>Join the Play</h2>
<p>
  Whether it’s your little one’s first crawl, a rainy-day retreat, or your go-to
  meet-up spot, we can’t wait to welcome you.
</p>
<p>Come for the coffee. Stay for the memories.</p>
